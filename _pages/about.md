My name is Bovornpratch Vijarnwannaluk (nickname: Klod). I am a post-doctoral researcher at the 
<a href='https://www.asiaa.sinica.edu.tw'> Academia Sinica Institute of Astronomy and Astrophysics (ASIAA) </a>. I graduated from the <a href='https://www.astr.tohoku.ac.jp/en/index.html'> Astronomical Institute</a> Tohoku University in Japan. Origianlly, I am from Bangkok where I did my undergraduate at the department of physics Chulalongkorn University.

My research is focused on investigating the cosmological evolution of Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) using large and deep X-ray datasets combined with deep optical and infrared imaging dataset. Currently I am using data taken by the James Webb Space telescope to study the role of AGNs in the evolution of galaxies evolution during the peak of massive black hole and stellar mass growth using X-ray and radio datsets. Check out the research page for more details.

I am also involved with a few other collaborations. Mainly, I am part of the AGN working group in the <a href='https://hsc.mtk.nao.ac.jp/ssp/'>Hyper Surpime-Cam Subaru Strategic Survey </a> (HSC-SSP) and recently now a new member of the <a href='https://pfs.ipmu.jp/intro.html'>Prime Focus spectrograph </a>  (PFS). Check out these projects if you are interested in deep and wide imaging and spectral surveys.
